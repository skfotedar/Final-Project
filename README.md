# Final Project Proposal
## MM Applications in Satellite Imagery
### Population Expansion and Coastal Reduction

This project is a collaborative effort of image processing and 
predictions for land use change.  Satellite imaging is convert to
data base format for building forecasting models of changes in patterns.  Two change patterns will be examined:  image indication of population growth (i.e. increase in light intensity) and coastal sea level rise impact (i.e. vegetation intensity).
The models will allow a user to select a future year to receive
feedback on the expected changes in land use availability based upon growth and/or coast reduction.
